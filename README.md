# chandu-distance
stupid program to calculate distance (combine Manhattan and euclidean but isnt Minkowski )

## Euclidean distance
This is the most commonly used distance metric, which calculates the straight-line distance between two points in n-dimensional space. It is based on the Pythagorean theorem and is effective for continuous variables

## Manhattan
Also known as L1-Norm, this distance metric calculates the distance between two points by summing the absolute differences between their coordinates. It is useful for high-dimensional data and emphasizes outliers due to its linear nature
 
## Minkowski
This is a generalization of Euclidean and Manhattan distances, which uses a parameter 𝑝 to determine the type of distance. When 𝑝=1, it becomes Manhattan distance, and when 𝑝=2, it becomes Euclidean distance. It is useful for simulating complex processes with more sophisticated variable relationships
